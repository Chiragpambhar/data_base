[1]  What do you understand By Database?
 ->   A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
       A database is usually controlled by a database management system.


[2]  What is Normalization?
 ->   Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, 
       Update and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. 
       The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate repetitive data and ensure data is stored logically.


[3]  What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS? 
 ->  DBMS stands for Database Management System, and RDBMS is the acronym for the Relational Database Management system. 
       In DBMS, the data is stored as a file, whereas in RDBMS, data is stored in the form of tables.


[4]  What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems? 
 ->   Rule 1: Information Rule.
       Rule 2: Guaranteed Access Rule. 
       Rule 3: Systematic Treatment of NULL Values.
       Rule 4: Active Online Catalog. 
       Rule 5: Comprehensive Data Sub-Language Rule. 
       Rule 6: View Updating Rule. 
       Rule 7: High-Level Insert, Update, and Delete Rule. 
       Rule 8: Physical Data Independence.
       Rule 9: Logical Data Independence.
       Rule 10: Integrity Independence.
       Rule 11: Distribution Independence.
       Rule 12: Non-Subversion Rule.


[5] What do you understand By Data Redundancy? 
 -> Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data exists in multiple places, whereas data inconsistency is when the same data 
     exists in different formats in multiple tables. Unfortunately, data redundancy can cause data inconsistency, 
     which can provide a company with unreliable and/or meaningless information.


[6] What is DDL Interpreter? 
 ->  DDL Full Form is Data Dafinition Language.DDL Interpreter as the name suggests interprets the DDL statements such as 
      schema definition statements like create, delete, etc.


[7] What is DML Compiler in SQL?
 ->  DML full form is data Manipulation Language. A DML refers to a computer programming language that allows you to add , delete , 
      and update data in a database.


[8] What is SQL Key Constraints? writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints?
  ->  SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. 
       This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, 
       the action is aborted. Example of SQL Key Constraints is NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY,UNIQUE etc.


[9]  What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?
 ->  A savepoint is a point in a transaction when you can roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction. 
      The syntax for a savepoint command is as shown below. SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME; This command serves only in the creation of 
      a savepoint among all the transactional statements.


[10]  What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?
   ->   A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs. 
         For example, a trigger can be invoked when a row is inserted into a specified table or when certain table columns are being updated.
        Explanation of syntax:
        create trigger [trigger_name]: Creates or replaces an existing trigger with the trigger_name.
        [before | after]: This specifies when the trigger will be executed.
        {insert | update | delete}: This specifies the DML operation.
        on [table_name]: This specifies the name of the table associated with the trigger.
        [for each row]: This specifies a row-level trigger, i.e., the trigger will be executed for each row being affected.
        [trigger_body]: This provides the operation to be performed as trigger is fired
